# AXIOM_LEXICON

- **ZKVSNodePrime**: RAM-proof, zero-dep execution core. Implements absolute inheritance and override logic.
- **AxiomShards-Catalyst**: Shard-lattice architectural motif. Enables scalable, modular stream processing.
- **ToST-linear**: Token-Oriented Stream Transformer. Core of AxiomShards, achieves linear time with statistical sufficiency.
- **QRGM**: Quantum-Resistant Gravity-Manifestation. Physically rooted key derivation, sidesteps cryptographic brute force.
- **L1C**: Level 1 Cache timing differential sampling engine.
- **FHE Sandbox**: Fully Homomorphic Encryption for secret transient compute (no disk exposure).
- **G-convex**: Proof output property; system result increases strategic operator advantage.
