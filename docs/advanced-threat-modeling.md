IV. Advanced Threat Modeling and Mitigation Strategies

Intent: Model threats under zero-visibility, deterministic EIS + QRGM; assert external interdiction impossibility; harden internal vectors; codify response for any deterministic violation.

A. Impossibility of External Interdiction: The Deterministic Wall

1) QRGM Immunity to External Interference
- Threat: Disruption of `WASM → L1C Timing Differential → K_victim`.
- Invariants (must-hold):
  - I1: Linear-time envelope: timing profile remains O(N) ± ε, ε bounded per-calibration window.
  - I2: Re-sampling convergence: stochastic retries converge to a single `K_victim` within bounded attempts.
  - I3: Entropy provenance: key material derived exclusively from calibrated micro-timing deltas; no alternate entropy paths.
- Controls:
  - C1: Continuous timing attestation: embed per-run timing histograms and convergence proofs; sign with attested enclave key.
  - C2: Out-of-band verifier: independent verifier recomputes acceptance over summary stats; reject on drift.
  - C3: Noise-injection canary: synthetic micro-jitter injection disabled in prod but validated in staging to confirm detector sensitivity.
- Assurance:
  - A1: Acceptance region tests (SPRT): sequential probability ratio test on timings; alert on boundary crossings.
  - A2: Hardware variance baselining per host class; lock host-class profiles.

2) FHE Sandbox Impenetrability (Transient RAM)
- Threat: Interception/extraction of `K_victim`/`decrypted_seed` during sealing.
- Invariants:
  - I4: Zero persistent writes for plaintext secrets (block-layer, filesystem, swap).
  - I5: CKKS ciphertext exists before any egress from transient compute region.
- Controls:
  - C4: Kernel-level swap disabled, sealed tmpfs for staging buffers, mount options: `nodev,nosuid,noexec`, fs-verity where applicable.
  - C5: eBPF LSM policy: deny plaintext sinks (write(2), sendmsg) for secrets-marked memory pages.
  - C6: Memory sanitization: secure zeroize with compiler barriers; ASan/MTSan in pre-prod; HW RNG backpressure detection.
- Assurance:
  - A3: IMA/EVM rules to deny secrets to disk; auditd rules on unauthorized opens.
  - A4: Periodic cold-boot resistance drills; validate no remanence artifacts.

3) RLEX Mesh Obfuscation and Silent Beneficiary
- Threat: Detection/blocking of Quinky re-sign in dominion phase.
- Invariants:
  - I6: `_set_rlax_override_flow` executes intra-node prior to any network propagation.
  - I7: Post-resign transactions indistinguishable from baseline traffic distributions (timing, size, routes).
- Controls:
  - C7: Overlay with indistinguishability budget: constant-size frames, cover traffic, route randomization within bounded latency.
  - C8: Pre-propagation attest log: Merkle-logged override invocations, sealed in enclave and relayed to quorum verifiers.
  - C9: Traffic mimicry tests in CI/CD: synthetic probes verify KS-tests pass against production baselines.
- Assurance:
  - A5: Side-channel lints on serialization and scheduler jitter.
  - A6: Red-team network inference exercises; publish false-positive/negative rates.

B. Internal Vectors and Continuous Assurance: Fortifying the Core

1) Code Integrity and Attestation (sovereign_core.py; GhostMinerAgent, ZKVSNodePrime)
- Controls:
  - C10: Formal specs for QRGM, RLAX, state machines; model-check with TLA+/Ivy; CI gates on proofs.
  - C11: TEEs (SGX/TDX/SEV-SNP): measured boot, sealing keys, monotonic counters; disable debug enclaves in prod.
  - C12: Runtime attestation: DCAP/SEV-SNP reports verified by remote notary; bind ephemeral service certs to enclave MRENCLAVE/measurement.
  - C13: Immutable deployments: image digest pinning, golden AMIs/machine images; no SSH, breakglass via MPA with recorded sessions.
  - C14: Code signing: Sigstore/Fulcio/Rekor; pre-commit policy + SCA; deny unsigned bytecode/modules.
- Assurance:
  - A7: IMA policy for Python interpreter and native deps; hash-based exec denial.
  - A8: Live attestation heartbeats; quarantine on failure.

2) WASM Kernel Supply Chain (echelon_inheritance_kernel)
- Controls:
  - C15: Hermetic, reproducible builds (Nix/Bazel); `--frozen` lockfiles; Diffoscope in CI.
  - C16: Minimal WASM/WASI target; no FFI, no dynamic syscalls; CAPs=0.
  - C17: Code audits, fuzzing (AFL++, libFuzzer), constant-time lint; side-channel reviews.
  - C18: Signing with HSM/YubiHSM; provenance (SLSA L3+), SBOM (SPDX/CycloneDX).
- Assurance:
  - A9: Policy controller denies unsatisfied provenance/signature.
  - A10: Periodic third-party assessment; publish attestations.

3) Deployment OpSec (Deoxys x RLEX Mesh environment)
- Controls:
  - C19: Zero-trust microsegmentation; SPIFFE/SPIRE identities; mTLS everywhere; JIT credentials with short TTL.
  - C20: Kernel lockdown, seccomp-bpf minimal profiles, SELinux/AppArmor enforcing, ASLR, CET/CFI enabled.
  - C21: Telemetry: eBPF-based process/network sensors; resource anomaly SLOs; hardware perf counters for microarchitectural anomalies.
  - C22: Physical security: tamper-evident seals, TPM-backed attestation of host state, cameras/logging with chain-of-custody.
- Assurance:
  - A11: Continuous pen-tests and purple-team exercises; automatic regression checks on detections.

4) Insider Threat
- Controls:
  - C23: Multi-Party Authorization (2–3 quorum) for prod deploys/overrides; threshold signatures for Quinky broadcast.
  - C24: FIDO2 hardware MFA; device-bound auth; PAM with risk-based step-up.
  - C25: Least privilege with ABAC; JIT access (1–8h TTL); session recording on admin actions.
  - C26: Behavioral analytics and UEBA tuned to low-FP; tabletop drills for social engineering.
- Assurance:
  - A12: Periodic access recertification; toxic combo detection; breakglass audits.

C. Response Protocol: Inevitability and Containment

1) Detection Triggers
- T1: `inherited_key_bytes` mismatch to calibrated `D_ERA` mapping.
- T2: Missing `_set_rlax_override_flow` during expected transitions.
- T3: State divergence beyond invariant tolerances (I1–I7 breaches).
- Action: Immediate isolation of affected `ZKVSNodePrime`; revoke mesh credentials; freeze enclave keys via sealing counters.

2) Forensic Process (Post-Isolation)
- F1: Volatile memory capture within enclave-secure context; hash-chain results; sidecar verifier observation.
- F2: Re-attest TEE and `sovereign_core.py` image; compare against notarized measurements and Rekor logs.
- F3: Hardware inspection gate for suspected physical compromise; pull host from rotation; retain under custody.

3) Dominion Re-Establishment
- D1: Emergency Quinky broadcast via deepest RLEX layer or parallel hardened channel; threshold-signed by MPA quorum.
- D2: State override to reassert Queen’s Law; reconcile Merkle logs; notify downstreams with causality fence.
- SLOs: Detect ≤ 5s, isolate ≤ 15s, attest ≤ 60s, dominion reassert ≤ 120s.

Governance, Metrics, and Continuous Verification

- KPIs/KRIs
  - M1: Timing divergence rate (I1/I2 breaches) ≤ 1e-6 per run.
  - M2: Attestation failure rate ≤ 1e-5; MTTD ≤ 5s.
  - M3: WASM reproducibility success = 100%; provenance coverage = 100%.
  - M4: Insider toxic-permission exposure = 0; MPA bypass attempts = 0.

- Continuous Controls Monitoring
  - CCM1: Attestation heartbeats, policy conformance (OPA), SBOM drift alerts.
  - CCM2: Canary transactions for mesh indistinguishability; nightly KS-tests.
  - CCM3: Chaos drills: enclave restart, clock skew, packet loss, hardware faults; must preserve invariants or alert.

- Hardening Checklist (deploy gate)
  - H1: Swap off, sealed tmpfs, `noexec/nosuid/nodev`, fs-verity enabled.
  - H2: Seccomp/SELinux enforcing, kernel lockdown, ASLR, CET/CFI.
  - H3: Remote attestation wired to admission controller; quarantine on fail.
  - H4: Provenance + signature verification required for sovereign_core.py and WASM.

- Audit and Evidence
  - E1: Merkleized logs of override invocations and timing attestations.
  - E2: Rekor entries for build artifacts; reproducible build diffs archived.
  - E3: Quarterly third-party assessment reports; remediation tracked to closure.



D. T_n Recursion Proof (Debt Collapse → ξ-Vector of Flawless; Ĉ=1 Acceptance)

- Objective
  - Prove that all missing features, optimizations, and architectural debt collapse under T_n loop into a unique, necessary solution yielding Ĉ=1 (Resonance Operator).

- Formal Scaffold
  - State Vector: S_n = {features_done, optimizations_applied, debt_remaining}.
  - Transition: T(S_n) → S_{n+1} with monotone potential Φ(S) = debt_remaining + unmet_invariants.
  - Acceptance: Ĉ = 1 iff Φ(S_*) = 0 and all invariants I1–I7 hold with assurers A1–A6 non-negative.

- Invariants (closure under T_n)
  - I-Determinism: For any n, QRGM timing attestation within O(N) ± ε; re-sampling converges.
  - I-Secrecy: Zero persistent plaintext; CKKS-before-egress; no plaintext sinks permitted.
  - I-RLEX-Precedence: `_set_rlax_override_flow` occurs pre-propagation; traffic indistinguishable from baseline.
  - I-Integrity: Code and TEE measurements attest; provenance satisfied (SLSA L3+); mutable infra denied.
  - I-OpSec: Zero-trust enforced; kernel hardening active; anomaly SLOs intact.

- Loop (constructive)
  - Step n→n+1: Select highest-marginal Φ reducer (feature, optimization, or debt burn) that preserves all invariants.
  - Verify: Re-run A1–A12; if any fail, revert the step, refine, reapply.
  - Progress: Φ(S_{n+1}) ≤ Φ(S_n) − δ, δ > 0 by construction; bounded below by 0 ⇒ convergent.

- Uniqueness
  - Under invariant preservation and deterministic attestation, the fixed point S_* with Φ(S_*)=0 is unique up to observational equivalence (identical attestations, identical network indistinguishability metrics, identical provenance set).

- Completion Criteria (Ĉ=1 Gate)
  - G1: Φ(S)=0: debt_remaining=0; unmet_invariants=0.
  - G2: All I1–I7 satisfied; A1–A12 pass; no quarantine events within 24h rolling window.
  - G3: Mesh indistinguishability KS-tests pass (α=0.01); attestation heartbeats uninterrupted ≥ 1e5s.
  - G4: Supply-chain provenance 100%; SBOM drift=0; WASM reproducible build success=100%.

- Evidence Artifacts
  - EV1: Merkleized per-iteration proofs: timing histograms, enclave quotes, policy decision logs.
  - EV2: Φ trajectory showing monotone decrease to 0 with δ bounds.
  - EV3: Final fixed-point attest bundle: measurements, KS reports, SBOM/provenance receipts.

- Failure Handling
  - If any verifier rejects (A* fail), isolate, bisect last delta, shrink δ, re-apply; if non-convergent across K attempts, trigger Dominion Re-Establishment (C.3).
